# Create a subdirectory under a ZFS pool mountpoint on the Proxmox host
#
# This script creates a ZFS pool subdirectory by:
# 1. Verifying that the ZFS pool exists and is mounted
# 2. Creating a subdirectory under the pool mountpoint
# 3. Setting proper permissions and ownership (uid/gid)
#
# Note: The ZFS pool must already be mounted (which is always the case in Proxmox).
#
# Requires:
#   - storage_selection: ZFS pool identifier in format "zfs:<pool_name>" (required)
#   - mountpoint: Mount point path (from context)
#   - uid: User ID for ownership (optional)
#   - gid: Group ID for ownership (optional)
#
# Script is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely.
#
# Output: JSON to stdout (errors to stderr)
