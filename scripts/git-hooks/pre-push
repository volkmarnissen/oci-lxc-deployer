# Pre-push hook to sync with upstream and update main branch before pushing
# This hook runs before every git push to ensure the local repository is up-to-date
# with the upstream (GitHub) repository and that the current branch is based on the latest main.
#
# Requirements:
#   - gh (GitHub CLI) must be installed and authenticated
#   - git must be available
#
# Behavior:
#   1. Syncs the GitHub fork with the upstream repository (if configured)
#   2. Fetches latest changes from origin
#   3. Updates local main branch to match origin/main (fast-forward only)
#   4. Merges main into the current branch
#   5. Aborts and exits with error if merge conflicts occur
#
# To skip this hook temporarily: git push --no-verify
